If the backup cannot map a group to a name it stores the group in the manifest as <span class="id">false</span> then uses either the owner of $PGDATA to set the group during restore or failing that the group of the current user. This logic was not working correctly because the selected group was overwriting the user on restore leaving the group undefined and the user incorrectly set to the group.
